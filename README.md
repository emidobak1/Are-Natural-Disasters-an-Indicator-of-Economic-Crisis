# Are Natural Disasters an Indicator of Economic Crisis?

## Introduction
The world is warming at an alarming rate. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean surface temperature in 2020 was approximately 1.2Â°C higher than pre-industrial levels (1850-1900), with the past decade being the warmest on record. This project leverages the "Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data" to analyze trends in land and ocean temperatures over time and investigate the link between these trends and the occurrence of natural disasters. The goal is to identify the time frames with the most significant temperature spikes, understand the causes behind these changes, and explore their broader implications, including their impact on global debt and the frequency of climate-related disasters.

## Objective

Analyze historical temperature data to identify periods of significant increases in land and ocean surface temperatures.
Investigate the relationship between rising temperatures and the occurrence of natural disasters such as hurricanes, forest fires, heat waves, and floods.
Examine the implications of climate-induced disasters on global debt and human displacement.
Background
Rising global temperatures, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, influence both land and ocean surface temperatures. Land surface temperatures are more sensitive to change due to their lower heat capacity compared to oceans. Oceans can buffer heat through evaporation, whereas land heats and cools rapidly, making temperature changes more pronounced. This project uses a combination of land and ocean surface temperature data as a robust indicator of global warming. Additionally, the study will explore how these temperature changes amplify the frequency and severity of natural disasters, which, in turn, impact human lives and global economic stability.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and compiled by Berkeley Earth. It includes:

Over 1.6 billion temperature records from 16 pre-existing archives.
Data on global, land, and ocean temperatures, categorized by country, state, major city, and city.
A primary focus on land temperature, as it provides more visible and reliable measures of climate change.
To enhance the analysis, additional datasets related to natural disasters and their economic impact will be incorporated as the project progresses.
